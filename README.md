This Etch-A-Sketch project was made for the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s Foundation Course.

--- v1.0 ---
This is an Etch-A-Sketch inspired web drawing board.

Included features:
- Pencil color and size selection
- Board color and size selection
- An optional grid
- Eraser and clear buttons
- Random Mode:
When this mode is selected, it will randomly pick a color for every pixel drawn.

I never had an Etch-A-Sketch when I was a child, but I did have one of those magnetic drawing boards. That's the reason I implemented a slider to clear the board, just like the ones on magnetic boards.

To do:
- Use responsive web design to display the page properly on different screen sizes.
